# Machine Learning
My achievement in AI/ML era
#
## What is it? 🙋🏻
It's an open-source project for the ML course at the University of Würzburg.

The implementation of the neural network framework has been done without using any frameworks or libraries. It consistes **backpropagation** algorithm as well.

## Main Tools🛠
* Python🐍
* Numpy⊹
* Pandas🐼

You can see the results in the following video:

#### You can find our team's code base here:

##### [Neural Network Framework](https://github.com/fachter/neural-network-framework)



You can use the code base to train your Neural Network with any kind of input data. (it's the simple version of Keras Framework 😉😁)
We trained a model using recorded gesture videos by ourselves.


##### [Application](https://github.com/fachter/gesture-detection-neural-network)

We used the trained ML model to detect gestures live and used it to play Tetris and control [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/) slideshows.
