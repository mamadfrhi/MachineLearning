# Machine Learning
My achievement in AI/ML era

It's an open-source project for the ML course at the University of Würzburg.

The implementation of the neural network framework such as **backpropagation** has been done without using any frameworks or libraries.

You can see the results in the following:

#### You can find our team's code base here:
Neural Network Framework code-base attached below and you can use it to train a Neural Network with any kind of input data. (it's the simple version of Keras Framework 😉😁)
We trained a model using recorded gesture videos by ourselves.

We used the trained ML model to detect gestures live and used it to play Tetris and control https://revealjs.com/ slideshows.
