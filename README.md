# MachineLearning
My achievement in AI/ML era

### Neural Network Framework
It's an open-source project for the ML course at the University of WÃ¼rzburg.

The implementation of the neural network framework such as back propagation has been done without using any frameworks or libraries.

#### You can find our team's code base here:
You can find the Neural Network Framework below and use it to train a Neural Network with any kind of input data. We trained a model using recorded gesture videos by ourselves.

We used the trained ML model to detect gestures live and used it to play Tetris and control https://revealjs.com/ slideshows.
