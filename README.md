# MachineLearning
My achievement in AI/ML era

### Neural Network Framework
It's an open-source project for the ML course at the University of WÃ¼rzburg.
The implementation of the neural network such as back propagation has been done without using any frameworks or libraries.


You can see the result here

#### You can find our team's code here:
We trained our model by recorded gesture videos by ourselves and trained the ML model. You can find the Neural Network Framework below and use it to train a Neural Network with any kind of input data.

We trained a NN that can detect gestures live and used it to play Tetris and control https://revealjs.com/ slideshow.
